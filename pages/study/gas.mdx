# Gas Fees

In the Xone Chain network, gas fees are a fundamental component designed to support transaction processing, prevent spam, and contribute to the network’s economic sustainability. Each transaction on the network, whether it’s a simple token transfer or a complex smart contract interaction, requires users to pay gas fees in XOC. The gas fee model dynamically adjusts based on network congestion, ensuring that fees are appropriately allocated during high-demand periods.

## What is a Gas Fee?

In blockchain networks, a **Gas fee** refers to the cost users must pay to execute transactions or smart contracts. It’s a core part of the network’s operations and maintenance, ensuring that transactions are verified, processed, and that the network remains healthy and secure. Gas fees are used to compensate network validators, who are responsible for processing transactions and executing smart contracts, thereby ensuring network stability.

Within the Xone Chain network, **XOC** must be paid as a Gas fee for each transaction. Whether a simple token transfer or a complex smart contract interaction, users pay a specific amount of **XOC** to support the network's normal operations.

      <p>When a user initiates a transaction, a certain amount of XOC is paid as gas to compensate validator nodes for processing and validating the transaction. This fee incentivizes validators to prioritize transactions, allowing users willing to pay higher fees to have their transactions confirmed more quickly.</p>

    <CardBody className="px-3 pt-0 pb-3 text-small">
      <p>A unique feature of the fee structure is that a portion of each transaction fee is burned, meaning that a small amount of XOC is permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism reduces the total supply of XOC over time, aligning with long-term tokenomic goals. As transaction volume grows, the amount of XOC burned also increases, adding deflationary pressure that could positively impact the value of the token.</p>

      <p>The gas fee and burn mechanism are also key tools for maintaining network stability. By requiring users to pay gas for each transaction, the network discourages spam transactions and resource wastage.

## How can I pay less for gas?

In recent years, blockchain networks and transaction platforms have made significant strides in reducing Gas fees, a common pain point for users and developers, especially with the increasing popularity of DeFi and NFTs. To address this issue, many networks and platforms are actively exploring innovative solutions to lower transaction costs and improve efficiency. Reducing Gas fees can enhance user experience, lower operational costs, and make blockchain more accessible to a wider audience. If you want to reduce Gas fees on Xone Chain or other blockchain networks, consider the following strategies:

## What Causes High Gas Fees?

Gas fees are influenced by several factors, such as network congestion, transaction complexity, and scalability limitations. During peak transaction periods, users often pay higher fees to ensure timely confirmation. Developers can also contribute to network efficiency by optimizing smart contracts, as inefficient contracts consume more Gas and can lead to network congestion.

## How is Gas calculated?

Xone Chain’s Gas fee calculation follows a structure similar to Ethereum, consisting of three main components: **Gas Used**, **Base Fee**, and **Priority Fee**. The detailed formula for calculating the total Gas fee is as follows:

### **Gas Calculation Formula**

**Minimum Gas Price:** `min_gas_price = 0.01 Gwei`

**Total Gas Fee:** `Gas Fee = Gas Used × (Base Fee + Priority Fee)`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Base Fee**: This dynamic fee is automatically adjusted by the network to reflect the current congestion level on the blockchain. If demand in a block is high, the Base Fee increases; if demand is low, the Base Fee decreases. This adjustment mechanism ensures fair pricing and helps maintain network stability by managing congestion.

  **Priority Fee(Tip):**  The Priority Fee is an optional, additional fee users can include to incentivize miners to prioritize their transaction over others. By paying a higher Priority Fee, users can speed up their transaction confirmation, which can be particularly useful in periods of high network activity.
