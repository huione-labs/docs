**Cross-Chain Event Monitoring:** Extends Web3 subscriptions to track IBC-related events, providing developers with unified tools for multi-chain operations.

#### 3.6.3 Examples

1. **Smart Contract Interaction:**

A DeFi DApp interacts with a liquidity pool contract:

``` solidity showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.solidity"
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);
const balance = await contract.getPoolBalance();
console.log(`Pool balance: ${balance}`);
```

The Web3 Interface translates this into `eth_call` requests for execution.

2. **Real-Time Event Tracking:**

Subscribing to a contract's events:

``` solidity showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.solidity"
provider.on('Transfer', (from, to, value) => {
  console.log(`Transfer from ${from} to ${to} of ${value} tokens`);
});
```

### 3.7 Cross-Chain Bridge

The interoperability bridge links Xone Chain to other EVM-compatible and Cosmos SDK chains, enabling cross-chain liquidity, asset swaps, and interoperability between DApps on different chains. This bridge is secured through multi-signature and threshold encryption, ensuring both functionality and security.

**Decentralized Identity (DID) Management:** Users can maintain anonymous identity verification through privacy-focused DID solutions that operate on Xone’s bridge, allowing for secure authentication across applications without revealing personal information.

## 4. Consensus Mechanism

Xone Chain leverages a **hybrid Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus** mechanism, creating a robust and efficient framework for network security and scalability. This combination provides several key benefits:

**Efficient Transaction Processing**: PoS and DPoS both require significantly less computational power than Proof of Work (PoW), reducing energy consumption while maintaining a high throughput.

**Enhanced Security**: The hybrid structure increases fault tolerance by distributing network security responsibilities among both stakers and delegates, mitigating risks even if a subset of nodes becomes compromised.

**Scalability**: PoS consensus enables horizontal scalability, allowing the network to maintain performance as additional nodes are added, which supports the growth of high-volume applications on the chain.

Validator and delegate nodes are incentivized through staking rewards and transaction fees, creating a secure environment where participants are rewarded for contributing to network integrity and reliability. This incentive model promotes honest behavior and aligns network interests with security and decentralization.

## 5. Nodes

Xone Chain is a modular Layer 1 blockchain that enables users to participate through various node types, providing decentralized consensus and data availability support. With its multi-layer node structure and USDH stablecoin feedback loop, Xone Chain allows participants to contribute liquidity and staking for network growth, earning rewards and driving the ecosystem’s sustainability. Xone Chain supports multiple node types, each with unique functions to facilitate consensus and ensure data availability across the entire network:

<Image src="/images/Xone Chain Nodes.png" alt="Xone Chain Nodes" style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} layout="responsive" />

**Validator Nodes:** These nodes participate in the consensus by generating and validating blocks, ensuring the security of the network. By staking XOC, node operators can unlock node identities, participate in the consensus mechanism, and earn Annual Percentage Yield (APY) rewards based on the GV (Growth Value) calculated according to the chain’s Epoch block production cycle.

**Consensus Nodes:** These nodes synchronize the on-chain historical data of Xone Chain, maintaining the stability and reliability of the network.

**Data Availability Nodes:**

- **Bridge Nodes:** These nodes bridge blocks between the data availability network and the consensus network, enabling cross-chain operations.

- **Light Nodes:** Light nodes perform data availability sampling on the data availability network, ensuring data integrity and network security while reducing hardware requirements for node operation.

- **Full Storage Nodes:** Full storage nodes store all on-chain data without participating in consensus, providing comprehensive on-chain historical data to applications in need.

**Xone-Specific Nodes:**

- **Project Nodes:** Designed for developers, integrators, and ecosystem partners, project nodes participate in chain consensus and validation, earning XOC token rewards.

- **Organization Nodes:** Targeted at enterprises and large community groups with more extensive storage and computational resources, organization nodes enhance consensus security and promote the long-term development of Xone.

- **Individual Nodes:** Community members and individual users with lower hardware requirements can access personal nodes, which become part of the Xone ecosystem and provide Proof of Stake (PoS) yield benefits.

## 6. Transactions

In Xone, **transactions** represent cryptographic instructions sent from one account to another with the purpose of updating the state of the Xone network. Each transaction contains detailed information such as a nonce, sender and receiver addresses, transfer amount (if applicable), data, signatures, and other relevant information. Validators process and verify these transactions to ensure compliance with network rules. Once verified, the transaction is recorded in a block and added to the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent. 

Transactions on Xone are operations initiated by user-controlled accounts.For example, when **Alice** sends **100 XOC** to **Bob**, **the transaction** deducts this amount from **Alice**’s account and deposits it into **Bob**’s account. The core purpose of this operation is to update the blockchain state.

Once initiated, the transaction updates the network state and is broadcast to the entire blockchain network. Validators then verify and execute these transactions to ensure they conform to the network’s consensus rules. Each transaction contains key details, such as the sender and receiver addresses, the amount of XOC transferred, and any associated fees. All transactions are cryptographically signed to ensure authenticity and security.

Transactions require a **transaction fee** (paid in XOC) and must be included in a validated block to be considered complete. The transaction information includes:

``` js showLineNumbers copy filename="example.json"
{
  "nonce": 42,                                // Unique transaction identifier (from sender's account)

In Xone Chain, XOC determines the weight of each node in the network’s decision-making process. Under the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, validators will receive voting power proportional to the amount of XOC they stake. To execute transactions on the network, users must pay a “Gas” fee, which will be burned, permanently removing it from the circulating supply.

### 7.2 Key Features of XOC

**Ownership:** XOC empowers users with full control over their funds. By holding XOC, users effectively become their own bank, enjoying complete ownership and control over their tokens. 

**Security:** XOC is safeguarded by robust cryptographic algorithms and stored in personal wallets, ensuring the security of funds and transactions while preventing unauthorized access.

**Decentralization:** XOC utilizes the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, ensuring that no central authority controls the network. This enables decentralized management and governance.

**Accessibility:** Anyone with an internet connection and a compatible wallet can access XOC, enabling seamless participation for users worldwide.

**Flexibility:** XOC can be divided into extremely small units (as low as 0.00000000000000000001), facilitating transactions of any size—from micro-payments to large-scale transfers.

**Instant Payments:** XOC transactions occur without intermediaries, processed directly on-chain. This ensures payments are fast, seamless, and cost-effective, akin to peer-to-peer cash transactions.

### 7.3 Unique Attributes of XOC

**Support for the Xone Chain Network:** XOC is the core token of Xone Chain, used to pay transaction fees and incentivize validators who process and verify transactions. Every transaction on Xone Chain requires XOC for payment, which facilitates network operations.

**Validator Rewards:** Validators on Xone Chain are responsible for proposing and validating blocks. They are rewarded with XOC for maintaining the blockchain’s integrity.

**Staking and Network Security:** Users can stake XOC to secure the network. Staking XOC helps protect the network and provides rewards for participants. This supports the security and decentralization of Xone Chain.

**DeFi Capabilities:** XOC is used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling borrowing, lending, and earning interest.

**Transactions and Cross-Chain Payments:** XOC enables cross-chain asset transfers and is used to pay fees for multi-chain transactions. This supports the interoperability of Xone Chain across blockchain ecosystems.

## 8. Xone Accounts

The **Account** structure of Xone Chain enables seamless integration with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and Cosmos SDK functionalities, creating a unified model for managing assets, executing transactions, and interacting with decentralized applications across multiple chains. This account model ensures compatibility with Ethereum-based smart contracts while leveraging the modular capabilities of Cosmos.

### 8.1 Key Features of Xone Accounts

**Unified Address Format:** The account structure employs a single address format compatible with both EVM and Cosmos SDK. This design enables users to interact with Cosmos modules and EVM smart contracts using a consistent address, eliminating the need for separate accounts.

**Dual Functionality:** The account model supports native Cosmos SDK operations (such as staking, governance, and IBC transfers) alongside EVM-specific actions (such as deploying contracts and transferring tokens). This functionality allows users to perform a comprehensive range of interactions through a single account structure, simplifying the operational process.

**Cross-Chain Compatibility:** The account integrates with interoperability bridges, facilitating seamless asset and data transfers between Xone Chain and other blockchains within the Cosmos and Ethereum ecosystems. This is particularly suited for multi-chain applications and DeFi use cases.

**Enhanced Security:** Accounts include options for multi-signature and recovery protocols, providing additional layers of protection. These features make the account structure suitable for users and organizations with high security requirements.

**Privacy-Enhanced Transactions:** Accounts support privacy features such as zk-SNARKs and stealth addresses, enabling highly private and anonymous cross-chain transactions.

### 8.2 Account Architecture

Xone Accounts are built on a multi-layer architecture that enables both EVM and Cosmos SDK compatibility:

- **Cosmos Layer:** Manages native transactions (e.g., staking, governance) and cross-chain operations using the Cosmos SDK.
- **EVM Layer:** Handles Ethereum-compatible transactions, including smart contract deployments, token transfers, and DApp interactions.

Each Xone Account can store assets and data across both layers, providing a unified access point for all blockchain activities on Xone Chain.

### 8.3 Account Creation and Management

Users can create and manage Xone Accounts through wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Keplr) that support both Cosmos and EVM environment. Accounts are accessed via private keys, which enables transaction signing and submission across Cosmos and EVM environments seamlessly.

### 8.4 Xone Account Operations

**Token Transfers:** Transfer native Xone tokens or EVM-compatible tokens within the Xone ecosystem or across supported blockchains via the cross-chain bridge.\
**Smart Contract Interactions:** Execute Ethereum-based smart contracts and interact with DApps on the EVM layer directly from Xone Accounts.\
**Governance Participation:** Vote in network governance.

### 8.5 EIP-155: Replay Protection

To protect users against malicious replay attacks of transactions across different networks, Xone Chain integrates **EIP-155 replay protection** directly into its protocol. Each transaction includes a unique **chain ID** and **nonce**, which collectively ensure that transactions are valid only within the designated network. This mechanism prevents any Xone Chain transaction from being mistakenly or maliciously duplicated on other EVM-compatible or Cosmos-based chains.

The chain ID uniquely identifies the Xone network, signaling to validators that the transaction belongs exclusively to this environment. Paired with the incrementing nonce for each user transaction, this system effectively blocks replays by rejecting duplicate transactions across networks. By embedding EIP-155 replay protection at the protocol level, the network reinforces the integrity of cross-chain transfers and mitigates risks associated with unauthorized duplicate transactions.

For users participating across multiple blockchain ecosystems, this protection is critical. It ensures that assets and data remain confined to their intended chain, eliminating the potential for unintended exposure or security vulnerabilities when moving assets across different networks.

## 9. Gas and Fees

On the Xone Chain network, gas fees are a fundamental component supporting transaction processing, preventing spam, and maintaining the network’s economic sustainability. Every transaction on the network, whether a simple token transfer or a complex smart contract interaction, requires users to pay **XOC** as gas fees. The gas fee model dynamically adjusts based on network congestion to ensure appropriate fee allocation during periods of high demand.

### 9.1 Fee Structure and Allocation

**Transaction Processing**: When a user initiates a transaction, a certain amount of **XOC** is paid as gas to compensate validators for processing and verifying the transaction. The fee structure incentivizes validators to prioritize transactions, with users willing to pay higher fees receiving faster confirmation times.

**Burn Mechanism**: A unique feature of the fee structure is that a portion of each transaction fee is burned, meaning a small amount of **XOC** is permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary mechanism reduces the total supply of XOC over time as transaction volume grows, adding deflationary pressure that could positively impact the token’s value.

**Network Stability and Security**: The gas fee and burn mechanism are key tools for maintaining network stability. By requiring users to pay gas for each transaction, the network reduces the likelihood of spam transactions and resource wastage. The burn feature further enhances this by reducing the incentive for malicious actors to flood the network with unnecessary transactions, as the cumulative cost of doing so would lead to significant XOC burns.

**EVM and Cosmos Compatibility**: Xone Chain’s gas fee model is compatible with both EVM and Cosmos SDK frameworks, allowing for seamless fee calculation and burning on both layers. Whether transactions are processed on the EVM layer or uses Cosmos SDK functionality, the gas fee model remains consistent, transparent, and secure.

The gas calculations of Xone Chain consist of three components: Gas used, Base fee, and Priority fee. The specific calculation is as follows:

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
```math
GasFee=GasUsed*(BaseFee+PriorityFee)
```
</div>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Minimum gas** unit price 0.01 Gwei\
  **Base Fee:** This dynamic fee is automatically adjusted by the network to reflect the current level of congestion on the blockchain. If demand within a block is high, the base fee will increase; if demand is low, the base fee will decrease. This adjustment mechanism ensures fair pricing and helps maintain network stability by managing congestion.\
  **Priority Fee:** The priority fee is an optional additional fee that users can pay to incentivize miners to prioritize their transactions. By paying a higher priority fee, users can speed up the transaction  confirmation, which is especially useful during peak network activity periods.
</Callout>

### 9.2 EIP-1559: Transaction Fee Model

To optimize user transaction experience and enhance the fair allocation of network resources, **Xone Chain** integrates the **EIP-1559 transaction fee model** introduced by Ethereum. This model redefines the structure of transaction fees through dynamic base fee adjustment and  a fee burn mechanism, improving network usability and value stability.

**Dynamic Adjustment of Base Fee:** The base fee is the minimum fee paid for each transaction, determined by the congestion level of the current block. When block demand is high, the base fee will automatically increase; when the network is idle, the fee will decrease. This mechanism effectively mitigates the uncertainty caused by fee market volatility for users.

**Fee Burn Mechanism:** The paid base fee is directly burned from the network rather than paid to miners or validators. This not only reduces the number of tokens in circulation but also injects a natural deflationary property into Xone Chain's token model, thereby enhancing the long-term value of the token.

**Priority Fee:** To incentivize validators to prioritize certain transactions, users can pay an additional priority fee. This portion of the fee is directly earned by validators, ensuring flexibility and fairness in network transaction processing.

For example:

#### 1. Transaction Initiation Phase

A user wants to purchase a piece of artwork in the Xone Chain NFT marketplace for 5 XOC (Xone Chain’s native token). When the user initiates the transaction, the wallet application automatically queries the current network status, providing real-time base fee (Base Fee) and suggested priority fee (Priority Fee).

Example data:

- Current network base fee: **0.002 XOC**
- User-selected priority fee: **0.0005 XOC**
- Total transaction fee: **0.0025 XOC (Base Fee + Priority Fee)**

#### 2. Dynamic Adjustment of Base Fee

- **Network congestion:** If the current network demand is high (e.g., due to a popular NFT drop causing a surge in transactions), the base fee will automatically increase, such as adjusting from 0.002 XOC to 0.003 XOC.

- **Low demand:** If the network is under low load, the base fee may decrease to 0.0015 XOC. This mechanism ensures dynamic balance in resource allocation, preventing transaction processing capacity from being excessively occupied.

#### 3. Fee Burn Mechanism

Once the user’s transaction is successfully validated in the block, the **0.002 XOC base fee** paid is burned. This reduces the total supply of XOC in circulation, creating a deflationary effect that supports long-term value growth of the token.

**Example burn effect:** If there are 50,000 transactions on a given day, with each transaction burning 0.002 XOC, then **100 XOC** would be burned on that day by Xone Chain.

#### 4. Priority Fee Incentive

The **0.0005 XOC priority fee** paid by the user is directly rewarded to the validators. This mechanism provides additional income for validators, incentivizing them to prioritize the user's transaction, thus enhancing transaction confirmation speed and user experience.

#### 5. Transaction Packaging and Confirmation

- The user’s transaction is completed in less than 3 seconds because the user paid a priority fee, which the validators processed first.

- During the block packaging process, the base fee is burned, and the transaction result is recorded on-chain, ensuring immutability of the transaction.

## 10. Cross-Chain Interoperability

Xone **Interoperability Bridge** aims to enable the free flow of assets and data between Cosmos SDK and EVM-compatible networks, providing users and developers with a seamless    multi-chain interaction experience while expanding access to liquidity and decentralized application (DApp) functionality.
