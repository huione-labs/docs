## Our Color

Regarding our brand color gradient application, you can increase the color richness and enhance the applicability without changing the brand color system. To this end, we have defined the brand standard color `#FF0420` and `Pantone 485C` standard brand color to be suitable for various printing and scenes.

## Our Font

Our brand typography system is designed to ensure visual consistency and readability across various applications. We use **Figtree** as the primary English font, offering a modern and clean aesthetic that enhances our brand identity. For numerical content, we utilize **DIN-PRO**, providing clarity and a professional look. For multilingual support, we adopt **Noto Sans**, which ensures consistent typography across different languages. This system guarantees global readability and a cohesive visual experience across diverse media and platforms.
