# Block Explorers

Xone's design is transparent, ensuring that everything is verifiable. The official Xone block explorer provides an interface to access this information. If you need such data, you can retrieve it through the provided block explorer, which is available for both the Xone Mainnet and the Xone Testnet. Whether for you or your team, the explorers allow you to view real-time data on blocks, transactions, validators, accounts, and other on-chain activities—and much more.

## How to Access?
At Xone, we encourage more developers and community members to leverage the capabilities provided by Xone for secondary development to meet the specific needs of you or your team. To support this, we provide access to a <Link className='text-primaryHue' showAnchorIcon href="/developers/explorers#additional-list">verified list of block explorers</Link>.
