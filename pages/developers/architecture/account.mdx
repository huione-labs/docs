# Accounts

Accounts are essential components in the Xone Chain, built on the same principles as Ethereum's account system. They serve as entities that hold balances, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts.

## 1. Overview of Accounts

In the Xone, accounts are used to:
- Store XOC tokens and other on-chain assets.
- Sign and send transactions.
- Interact with smart contracts and other decentralized applications (DApps).

Accounts in Xone follow the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) model, ensuring compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

## 2. Account Types

### 2.1 Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

**Controlled By:** A private key held by the account owner.

**Purpose:**
- Initiates transactions such as token transfers or contract calls.
- Does not contain code or logic, serving only as a basic entity for holding funds.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Associated with a public-private key pair.
- Transactions must be signed using the private key.
- Requires gas for transactions initiated.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="EOA Transfer Transaction.json"
{
  "from": "0xSenderAddress",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "value": "1000000000000000000", // 1 XOC in wei
  "gas": 21000,
  "gasPrice": "20000000000"
}
```
### 2.2 Contract Accounts

**Controlled By:** Smart contract logic deployed on the blockchain.
- Executes predefined logic when triggered by a transaction or internal message.
- Used for applications like DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Contains code and state.
- Cannot independently initiate transactions; it only reacts to external inputs.
- Executes logic defined in its bytecode.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Contract Interaction.json"
{
  "from": "0xUserAddress",
  "to": "0xContractAddress",
  "data": "0xa9059cbb0000000000000000000000000xRecipientAddress0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
  "gas": 60000
}
```

## 3. Account Address

### 3.1 Address Format

Xone accounts use the same Ethereum hexadecimal address format:
- 20-byte address represented as a hexadecimal string prefixed with 0x.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Example.json"
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

### 3.2 Address Generation

An account address is derived from the public key using the Keccak-256 hashing algorithm:
1. Generate a public-private key pair.
2. Hash the public key using Keccak-256.
3. Take the last 20 bytes of the hash as the address.

## 4. Account Functionality
### 4.1 Transaction Signing
Transactions initiated by an EOA must be signed with its private key. This ensures:

1. Authenticity: Verifies the transaction is authorized by the account owner.
2. Integrity: Prevents tampering with the transaction data.

```json showLineNumbers copy filename="Signing a Transaction.json"
Transaction Hash: 0xTransactionHash
Signature: 0xSignature
```

### 4.2 Nonce Management

A nonce is a counter that ensures transactions are processed sequentially and prevents replay attacks.

**How It Works:**
- Each transaction from an account must include a nonce.
- The nonce starts at 0 and increments with each processed transaction.
- If a transaction with an incorrect nonce is submitted, it is rejected.

### 4.3 Multisignature Accounts

Accounts requiring multiple signatures to authorize transactions.
- Used by DAOs or joint ventures to manage shared funds securely.

**Example:** 3-of-5 Multisig: Three of the five key holders must sign for the transaction to be valid.

### 4.4 Contract-Based Account Logic
**Account Abstraction:**

- Smart contracts can be used to enhance account functionality, such as enabling account recovery or implementing dynamic fee structures.

## 5. Account Creation
### 5.1 Creating an EOA
EOAs are created by generating a public-private key pair using wallet software like MetaMask or Ledger.

Steps to Create an EOA:
1. Open a wallet application.
2. Select "Create New Account."
3. Securely back up the private key or seed phrase provided by the wallet.

## 5.2 Deploying a Contract Account
Contract accounts are created by deploying a smart contract to the blockchain.

```js showLineNumbers copy filename="Contract Deployment Using ethers.js"
const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyContract");
const contract = await Contract.deploy();
console.log(`Contract deployed at address: ${contract.address}`);
```

## 6. Security Considerations
### 6.1 Private Key Management
- Store private keys in secure environments (e.g., hardware wallets or encrypted files).
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible.

### 6.2 Smart Contract Security
- Audit contract logic to minimize vulnerabilities.
- Implement fail-safes to handle unexpected contract failures.
